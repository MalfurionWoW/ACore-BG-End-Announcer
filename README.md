![](https://i.imgur.com/nSKYU4b.png)

This is a lua script for azerothcore with eluna engine module to announce when a battleground end, showing the team who win, and top kill, top heal and top damage.

## How to install:

Install your [AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) with the [Eluna Lua Engine module](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-eluna-lua-engine), setup the simple configuration of the eluna module.

After this, add the ``elunabgann.lua`` script to the ``lua_scripts`` folder (can be changed under the eluna module configs).

Restart the server or use the ``.reload eluna`` command.
